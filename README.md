# Agricultural Robot – Smart Plant Care Assistant

## Overview

The Agricultural Robot is a smart, automated system designed to take care of plants by monitoring soil moisture and controlling irrigation. It is built to assist both farmers and urban plant owners, ensuring that plants receive the right amount of water at the right time, consistently and efficiently.

## Introduction

Agriculture is a cornerstone of our economy, and healthy plants are essential for maximizing crop yield. However, inconsistent watering—too much or too little—can significantly affect plant growth and productivity.

The Agricultural Robot addresses this problem by automating soil monitoring and irrigation. With minimal human intervention, it helps plants thrive and reduces the effort required to care for them.

## Problem Statement

- Many farmers are unsure about the exact water requirements for their crops.
- Urban plant owners often forget or are too busy to water their plants regularly.
- Improper watering can stress plants, stunt growth, and even lead to crop loss.

## Our Solution

The Agricultural Robot provides a simple, practical solution through automation:

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Continuously measures soil moisture to determine when plants need water.
- **Automated Irrigation:** Activates a water pump only when necessary, preventing overwatering.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays the system’s status on a 16x2 LCD, showing whether the pump is on or off.

By automatically stopping irrigation when the soil reaches the right moisture level, the system conserves water and keeps plants healthy.
